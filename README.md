# ML-Basic-to-Advance
This repository contains all machine learning algorithms and everything you need to learn from basic to advance.
ML- focus on building system that learns from data.
Achieving high accuracy is not main goal for companies, they don't care about model accuracy.
There ultimate Goal is to increase profit directly of indirectly.

Requirements of ML System:

1)Reliability= correctness (eg:your system might call the predict function"model.predict()"correctly but predictions are wrong )

2)Scalability= Easily scalable system

3)Adaptablility

4)Maintainability


Real Process for building ML System

1) Choose metric to optimize
2) collect data & obtain labels
3) Feature engineering
4) Train model
5) Error analysis- you realize that errors are caused by wrong labels- relable the data
6) Train model again
7) If model perform well on existing test data, which is bynow two month old data but poorly on yesterdays data
8) Train model again on new dataa
9) Deploy the model
